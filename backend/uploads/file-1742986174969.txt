The Online Quiz Application is an advanced web-based platform designed to offer a customizable and engaging quiz experience. It features two primary modes: topic-based quizzes and document-based quizzes, powered by OpenAI’s GPT model.

Topic-Based Mode: Users select a subject (e.g., Science, History, Geography), and the app generates a set of dynamic quiz questions tailored to the chosen topic. OpenAI’s GPT ensures the questions are relevant, engaging, and diverse.

Document-Based Mode: Users can upload documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.), and the app extracts key points from the text to generate quiz questions based on the document's content.

Additionally, the app includes user profiles, where each user can track progress, and access their scores at any time. This encourages ongoing engagement and provides valuable insights into learning progress.

By leveraging OpenAI’s powerful AI capabilities, the app ensures quizzes are dynamic, relevant, and tailored to user preferences. This combination of AI-driven content generation, flexible settings, and personalized tracking makes the Online Quiz Application an effective tool for learning, self-assessment, and knowledge retention.


Existing System:

Currently, most online quiz applications are limited to static question banks, where users take quizzes from a predefined set of questions. These systems typically offer only one mode, such as multiple-choice questions, and lack personalization. While some platforms may allow users to upload documents, they often require manual formatting or don’t generate dynamic, tailored questions based on document content. Additionally, tracking progress or scores over time is typically not integrated, limiting user engagement and learning insights. Most quiz platforms lack time-management features or adaptive learning that personalizes the quiz experience according to user progress.

Proposed System:

The Online Quiz Application with Dynamic Questions and Timer addresses the limitations of existing systems by providing two primary quiz modes: Topic-Based Mode and Document-Based Mode. Users can choose a subject (e.g., Science, History) or upload documents (PDF, DOCX) to dynamically generate quiz questions. The system uses OpenAI's GPT to ensure that the questions are contextually relevant, engaging, and diverse. The app features an integrated login system that allows users to track their progress and scores, making it easier to monitor learning outcomes over time. A built-in timer adds a layer of challenge and helps users manage their time efficiently. This combination of AI-powered content generation, flexible settings, and personalized tracking makes the system more engaging, adaptive, and effective for knowledge retention compared to existing quiz platforms.

Existing System:

Most current online quiz applications offer static question banks with limited subject options. Users typically cannot upload documents, and questions are pre-defined rather than dynamically generated. These systems often lack features for tracking progress or scores and may not include time-management options to enhance user experience.

Proposed System:

The Online Quiz Application with Dynamic Questions and Timer improves on existing systems by offering two quiz modes: Topic-Based and Document-Based. Users can either select a subject or upload documents (PDF, DOCX) to generate dynamic, AI-powered quiz questions using OpenAI’s GPT. The system includes a login feature for tracking progress and scores, as well as a timer to help manage time. This combination of dynamic content, personalization, and tracking makes the system more engaging and effective.
